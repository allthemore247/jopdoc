# Jopdoc

This Joplin plugin allows for exporting notes from Joplin to the DocX format.

Pandoc is required for this plugin, which can be installed from [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html). The system path environment variable might also need to be set for Pandoc.

## More formats from Pandoc are planned, eventually. Probably. Hopefully.
